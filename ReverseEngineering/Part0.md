### Assembler
* CPUs execute machinecode, which is an efficient representation of instructions for the processor to execute. 
* Assembly language is a human-readable representation of machine code.
* A program that is capable of converting assembly code into machine code ready to be executed by the CPU is known as an assembler
* There is no agreed-upon standard for x86-64 Assembly.
** For this reason, no assembler will be axactly the same, although it is likely there will be similarities

### Debugger
* We use debuggers to examine the state of our programs.
** State refers to the arrangement of bits at the particular time/what the program is doing

### The Big Picture
* CPUs can only perform certain actions.
** A CPU's instruction set refers to the things that it is designed to do.]
* Instructions tend to be very simple.
* The CPU has registers, which is very fast memory.
* The instructions and data are stored in memory

### Registers
* Special kind of memory built into the CPU. 
* Very small, exrtremely fast.
* Many diffrent kinds, including one called general-purpose
* There arae 16 general purpose registers
* Each register  is 64 bits wide, or 8 bytes
* lower byte, word, and, double word can be addressed indiviudally
** 1 "word" = 2 bytes, 1 "double-word" = 4 butes
What is a word?
